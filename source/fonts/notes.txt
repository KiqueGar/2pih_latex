Miscelanea.ttf:
I have no idea where the Miscelanea font comes from. It has only two
characters: a star symbol mapped to '*' and a three-stars symbol mapped to '#'.

Twilight.ttf:
The Twilight font appears to be from a former user of DevianArt named
sheslikeadream. I was unable to find more information. Note that this is not
the same font as "Twilight New Moon".
